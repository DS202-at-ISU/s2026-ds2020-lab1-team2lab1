# Lab report \#1

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

# Our notes

### step 12.1

- Jacob’s note: Successfully followed all the instructions for
  prerequisites.
- Logan’s note: Had everything done so I moved on to next step.
- Sebastian’s note: No issues with this part.
- Alina’s note: No issues with this part.

### step 12.2

- Jacob’s note: We made a repo GitHub by accessing the github HTTPS
  link.
- Logan’s note: The link for the repo was given to us so we moved on to
  next step.
- Sebastian’s note: We already got the link for the repo through the
  Canvas announcement.
- Alina’s note: No major issues, had trouble with initial start of task
  but figured it out with help from Jacob :)

### step 12.3

- Jacob’s note: We followed all the instructions from the textbook and
  successfully create the project.
- Logan’s note: We copied the link that was given in the repo and used
  that.
- Sebastian’s note: I created a new project through RStudio and copied
  the link at the Git option.
- Alina’s note: No issues with this part.

### step 12.4

- Jacob’s note: We make any local changes on our own and commit the
  changes. The recent version was visually clear and clean.
- Logan’s note: I didn’t have any issues with this step so I just
  committed the thing locally.
- Sebastian’s note: Committed, but it prompted me to enter my Github
  username and token.
- Alina’s note: The initial statement did not come through for everyone.

### step 12.5

- Jacob’s note: Push and pull method was kind of hard that there are
  some issue with merge or having any other updated sources. But we
  figured out how to deal with the error.
- Logan’s note: I struggled with the merge because I wasn’t logged in to
  the correct account. Had to create a personal token to login. Had to
  select “repo” check box.
- Sebastian’s note: I had accidentally joined the wrong team repository,
  so I repeated every step up until this point.
- Alina’s note: Merge issues. Asked professor for help and was able to
  resolve. Updates come through smoothly now

### step 12.6

- Jacob’s note: We all confirm that our work is updated on the GitHub
  including commits, pulls, and pushes.
- Logan’s note: It took some work but we found that if we all wait for
  commits, pulls, pushes, then we were smooth sailing.
- Sebastian’s note: Professor Will helped me understand how the whole
  push and pull process works for the repository, so now I feel more
  confident for this.
- Alina’s note:everything is coming through smoothly, all commits,
  pulls, and pushes seem to be working.

## Overall

- We are able to understand how it works and learned some knowledge for
  our future project.
